One of general rules for software design is to degrade coupling between modules so that software architecture is flexible and scalable. Along with software evolution it is better to keep user interface stay similar which helps users to upgrade, and to keep programming interface consistent for the same functionality which is undoubtedly beneficial to programmers. In this paper, we discuss about these situations along a real development case study and propose a few systematic solutions which facilitate source code reuse and assure software quality. Detailed analysis and comparison are provided to show their effectiveness.},

However, it is not clear whether these expensive physical investments are an eﬀective strategy to encourage people to cycle more in cities where there is a high level of precipitation. The evidence is limited, partly due to data limitations. We used crowdsourced cycling data (taken from the Strava activity-tracking app) and ﬁxed-eﬀects panel regression models to investigate whether providing safe cycling infrastructure could be an eﬀective way to overcome adverse weather conditions. We selected the city centre of Glasgow, Scotland because of the current size and scope of investments. We found that providing safe cycle paths could encourage people to cycle more, especially on dry days. However, ﬁndings suggested that rainy cities like Glasgow may not have realised the full beneﬁts of safe cycling infrastructure because there are larger reductions in the volume of cycling on rainy days on these routes. Planners, especially from cities with a high level of precipitation, should consider how to improve cycle paths to overcome adverse weather and other policies (e.g., providing shower facilities at workplaces, incentives to cycle, etc.) to increase cyclists’ resilience to bad weather.},

	abstract = {To transition towards sustainability and increase low-impact transportation, city planners are integrating bicycle infrastructure in urban landscapes. Yet, this infrastructure only promotes cycling according to how well it is sited within a specific city. How to best site bicycle facilities is essential for sustainability planning. We review approaches to assessing and siting new bicycle facilities. Following sustainability science, we argue that active cyclists should be consulted to incorporate users’ site-specific knowledge into bicycle infrastructure assessments. We then pilot an approach that surveys cyclists concerning level of stress along routes ridden in St. Louis, {MO}, {USA}. Among the active cyclists surveyed (n = 89), we found stress correlates with speed limit, roadway classification, and number of lanes. Although cyclists surveyed in St. Louis prefer roads with bike lanes over roads with sharrows or no infrastructure, the presence of bicycle infrastructure had no correlation with reported levels of stress. The piloted survey and spatial analytic tool are transferable to other localities. For planners, the maps generated by this participant data approach identify high-stress routes as targets of new infrastructure or information to direct cyclists to safer routes. For bicyclists, the maps generated identify low-stress routes for recreation and commuting.},

This study examines the behavior of cyclists using an instrumented city bicycle that allows collecting exact data about bicycle dynamics, trajectory, and speed, as well as essential information to study the behavior of the cyclists, their reaction to the different features of the road surface and geometric design, and their interaction with other road users such as pedestrians, vehicles and other cyclists. 22 cyclists participated in an experiment following a predetermined route in Stockholm, Sweden. The route consisted of a circuit with different types of cycling facilities in order to study the different interactions (cyclist-car and cyclist-pedestrian), the circuit was divided into 3 zones: the first is mixed traffic, the second is a separate cycling lane and the third is shared pedestrian-cycling path. The results show significant data to evaluate cycling safety and comfort in snowy weather conditions and the perception-reaction behavior of cyclists; accordingly, the infrastructure-related risks were evaluated from subjective and objective points of view. In this paper, we propose a new concept to evaluate cycling behavior. This concept allows us to evaluate cyclists’ behavior through the calculation of Behavioral Risk Indicator ({BRI}) based on different risk factors owing to weather, road and traffic conditions, interaction with other road users and reaction to infrastructure drawbacks. The applications of the proposed concept allow us to evaluate the risks caused by multiple traffic factors and infrastructural drawbacks and study cyclist–bicycle–road interactions and their influences on cycling safety. In addition, the concept provides a new foundation for establishing cycling safety measures that could be applied to improve the infrastructure and reduce traffic accidents in order to attract more people to ride bicycles.},

Heart rate is often used as a means of measuring the intensity and energy expenditure of physical activity. However, heart rate is also linked to emotional factors such as anxiety and fear. Perceptions of risk due to external factors such as other road users and infrastructure may arouse such emotions in urban cyclists. The present study set out to investigate whether or not perceptions of risk among urban cyclists may lead to increased heart rates. Cyclists completed a test route in normal traffic conditions in Cork, Ireland and heart rates and self-reported risk ratings were recorded in real time. Evidence was found of a link between perceptions of risk and heart rates. This raises questions regarding the use of heart rate to estimate exercise intensity and energy expenditure during urban cycling. The perceptions of cyclists of their safety in relation to various road elements on familiar routes were also assessed, as well as specific events which they perceive to be high in risk. The results indicate that incidents involving car traffic and busy roads which offer no protection from interaction with car traffic are associated with greatest perceptions of risk.},

	abstract = {Objective
Quantify the impact of weather conditions on individual decisions to commute to work by bicycle among a diverse panel of adults who commute ≥2miles each way.
Method
Working adults (n=163) in a northern U.S. state reported transportation mode for four seven-day periods in 2009–2010 that maximized seasonal weather variations. Personal characteristics, trip to work distances, and commuting mode data were linked to location- and time-specific weather data and daylight hours. Analyses focused on effect of weather conditions on reports of commuting by bicycle.
Results
Participants were diverse in age, gender and bicycle use, but were relatively well-educated; they traveled to work by bicycle on 34.5\% of the logged commuting days. Modeling indicated that the likelihood of bicycle commuting increased in the absence of rain (odds ratio=1.91; 95\% confidence interval 1.42, 2.57) and with higher temperatures (1.03; 1.02, 1.04), and decreased with snow (0.90; 0.84, 0.98) and wind (0.95; 0.92, 0.97). Independent effects also were found for bicycle commuting distance, gender, and age, but not for daylight hours.
Conclusion
Precipitation, temperature, wind and snow conditions had significant and substantial independent effects on the odds of travel to work by bicycle among a diverse panel of adult bicycle commuters.},

Research is carried out to compare the cycle infrastructure in selected European cities against an adapted Level of Service concept using accompanied ride-alongs. The literature review on the factors that encourage/dissuade cycle use suggests that it is the potential rider’s perceptions on the safety of cycling in their neighbourhood that is the deciding feature. Moreover, the literature review showed that contextual factors such as whether the actual infrastructure meets the needs of different cyclists are relatively under-researched. Six case study cities were selected (Edinburgh, Cambridge, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht) and compared on a range of factors by the riders including the coherence, directness, attractiveness, safety and comfort of the network. A cycle infrastructure scoring system was derived from the cycling research literature and the research was carried out by the researcher, an experienced cyclist, accompanied by an inexperienced cyclist. Using this research, the article makes several recommendations for improving and enhancing existing cycle infrastructure provision.},

A unique data set of cyclist ridership, collected at five automatic counting stations on primarily utilitarian bike facilities in the city of Montreal, Canada, was used. Absolute and relative ridership models were used to analyze the direct and lagging effects of weather variables and extreme weather conditions on hourly cyclist volumes. Precipitation, temperature, and humidity had significant effects on bicycle ridership. After other factors were controlled for, when the temperature doubled, a 43\% to 50\% increase in ridership could be expected; however, the temperature had a negative effect when it was higher than 28°C and humidity was greater than 60\%. The results also showed that bicycle volumes in a given hour were significantly affected not only by the presence of rain in the same hour but also by the presence of rain in the previous 3 h or in the morning only. Daily bicycle volumes were 65\% to 89\% lower on weekend days than on Monday, the weekday with lowest ridership. This finding confirmed that the analyzed facilities were primarily utilitarian. Further, bicycle volumes peaked in the summer months, with an additional ridership of 32\% to 39\% with respect to April. Finally, bicycle volumes increased by approximately 20\% to 27\% in 2009 and 35\% to 40\% in 2010 with respect to 2008 in the cycling facilities under analysis.},

	abstract = {{JavaScript} programming language has been in existence for many years already and is one of the most widely known, if not, the most used front-end programming language in web development. However, {JavaScript} is still evolving and with the emergence of {JavaScript} Frameworks ({JSF}), there has been a major change in how developers develop software nowadays. Developers these days often use more than one framework in order to fulfil their job which has given rise to the problem for developers when it comes to choosing the right {JavaScript} framework to develop software which is partly due to the availability of countless numbers of {JavaScript} frameworks and libraries. Moreover, the use of {JavaScript} is getting more important for web development and thus, there has been major considerations done about the performance aspect of the {JavaScript} programming language. Thus, this work investigates current research regarding the comparison of {JavaScript} frameworks through the use of computer benchmarks. A benchmark reference application that simulates user events was developed which then incorporated the implementation of an application developed in each of the {JavaScript} frameworks chosen. In addition, software complexity metrics was introduced and experiments were conducted to measure these metrics. Overall, this research hopes to achieve a level of comparison which can further garner knowledge towards comparing {JavaScript} frameworks.},

	abstract = {It is generally understood that building software systems with components has many advantages but the diﬃculties of this approach should not be ignored. System evolution, maintenance, migration and compatibilities are some of the challenges met with when developing a component-based software system. Since most systems evolve over time, components must be maintained or replaced. The evolution of requirements aﬀects not only speciﬁc system functions and particular components but also componentbased architecture on all levels. Increased complexity is a consequence of diﬀerent components and systems having diﬀerent life cycles. In component-based systems it is easier to replace part of system with a commercial component. This process is however not straightforward and diﬀerent factors such as requirements management, marketing issues, etc., must be taken into consideration. In this paper we discuss the issues and challenges encountered when developing and using an evolving component-based software system. An industrial control system has been used as a case study.

	abstract = {One of the most used tools for creating interactive, advanced, and easily maintainable websites in 2020 is the programming language {JavaScript}. Over the last decade, many front-end frameworks have been built on top of {JavaScript}, which makes creation, design, and maintenance of interactive websites easier. As of 2020, the most popular front-end {JavaScript} frameworks were, by a large margin, React and Vue, followed by Angular. A relatively new framework called Svelte was also gaining in popularity and raised developer interest. This study will evaluate the performance of these front-end {JavaScript} frameworks. The criteria for evaluation are primarily based on speed of completing certain operations related to {DOM} elements in the web browser, such as {DOM} element addition, editing, and removal. Non-technical evaluation points include differences in architecture, development experience, popularity, maturity, and availability.

To set the context for the study of these frameworks, the study begins with an outline of the history and development of {JavaScript}. Its current status and versions are also described. Surrounding technologies relevant to the study are presented, such as {DOM} and {HTML}. Following this, the key features of front-end {JavaScript} frameworks are investigated, and the development setup process for a generic framework is documented. The criteria for selecting frameworks for evaluation is presented, and the four selected front-end frameworks are then investigated and evaluated. A benchmark {JavaScript} application is described and created for each of the frameworks. With this reference application, a number of technical benchmarks are performed, where the frameworks are rated according to how well they perform various {DOM} data updates. Finally, a recommendation is made on which frameworks are best suited for use, and how the future landscape of front-end {JavaScript} frameworks is likely to develop.},

	title = {In-depth Survey of {MVVM} Web Application Frameworks},
	abstract = {Frameworks that adopt the Model-View-Controller ({MVC}) design pattern have been extensively used in the web community for the development of fully-ﬂedged web applications. Such frameworks enable eﬃcient incremental updates on the application’s state and visual layer, but they usually enforce the extended use of imperative logic in order to accomplish this eﬀect. As an application is extended with additional functionality, the development process soon becomes extremely arduous and error-prone. This has lead to the emergence of Model-View-{ViewModel} ({MVVM}) and Web Component libraries that achieve higher developer productivity by keeping the required source code minimal and well-organized. Such frameworks can also provide additional mechanisms that automatically maintain the application state and the respective visual layer in sync, thus alleviating the application developer from this task. On the downside such mechanisms can negatively impact the performance of a given application and cause noticeable irregularities to the user experience.},
