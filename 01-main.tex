%% It is useful to split the document up as chapters and include

%% for you --- if you run it enough times!

\begin{abstract}
    Cyclists regularly use route planning applications to determine the route they take for their journey, whether to commute, complete a short-circuit ride or a long-distance ride. There is a range of pre-existing applications to allow cyclists to do this; however, most of these have a limited range of customisable criteria considered in the routing algorithm.

    This dissertation will investigate how the current solutions consider user-customisable criteria in their routing algorithms and will provide an open-source prototype system. The proposed system will consider pre-existing data, such as weather forecasts and hazard data, whilst catering for custom criteria chosen by the user and location of accommodation for long-distance routes.

%%%% These are macros ( each macro is defined by \newcommand )
%%%% These macros make cross-referencing easier, building on the
%%%% already very useful \autoref{ref}.  You tweak them or build your own.

%% \autorefp{ref}
%% Like \autoref, but adds the page number
%% e.g. Section 3.2.4 (p345)
\newcommand{\autorefp}[1]{\autoref{#1} (p\pageref*{#1})}

%% \autorefnp{ref}
%% Like \autoref, but adds both the section name and page number
% e.g. Section 3.2.4 "blah blah" (p345)
\newcommand{\autorefnp}[1]{\autoref{#1} ``\nameref{#1}'', (p\pageref*{#1})}

%% \see{ref}
%% Handy shorthand for inserting a hyperlinked xref.
%%   e.g. (see Section 3.2.4, p134)
%%        (see Figure 5.1, p23)
%%        (see Table 4.7, p999)
\newcommand{\see}[1]{\hyperref[#1]{(see \autoref*{#1}, p\pageref*{#1})}}

%% \seenamed{ref}
%% Handy shorthand for inserting a hyperlinked xref that also includes
%% the name of the section being referred to.
%% (see Section 3.2.4 "blah blah", p134)
%% (see Figure 5.1 "blah blah blah!", p23)
%% (see Table 4.7 "blah blah blah blah blah blah", p999)
\newcommand{\seenamed}[1]{\hyperref[#1]{(see \autoref*{#1} ``\nameref*{#1}'', p.\pageref*{#1})}}

%% \bq Block Quotations.
\newcommand{\bq}[2][]{\singlespacing \begin{quote} 
\begin{small} ``\textit{#2}'' \end{small} #1 \end{quote} \doublespacing}

%% \qq{quotation}
%% Shortcut for doing inline quotations (with 6699 quotation marks around italic text)
%% e.g. \qq{To be, or not to be}
\newcommand{\qq}[1]{{\enquote{\textit{#1}}}}
